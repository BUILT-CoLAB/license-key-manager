            <p>The essence of a fully-functional Multi-Purpose License Key Manager relies in the ability of administrators to correctly use and manage the structure of the service they are providing.</p>
            <p>With that in mind, the goal of the present tutorial page is to sharpen such abilities and to explain the core features of the system we have at hand. Despite complex and somewhat intimidating, the interface is friendly enough to guide you through the required steps. As such, by the end of this tutorial, you should have a clear understand of how to:</p>
            <ul role="list">
            <li>create, delete and edit <strong>Customers</strong> and <strong>Licenses</strong> from the web application</li>
            <li>navegate through the interface and recognize the functionalities in each tab</li>
            <li>understand the constraints we have in place</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This tutorial is divided into multiple segments where each one is dedicated to the different pages the web application is designed to serve.</p>
            <h2>1. The Dashboard</h2>
            <p>This is the front-page of our interface and the one that displays a simplified overview of the statistics. Users who manage to go through the authentication process are automatically redirected to this page.</p>
            <figure>
                <img class="w-full rounded-lg" src="{{ url_for('static', filename='prints/PRINTdashboard.png') }}" alt="" width="1310" height="873">
                <figcaption>The Dashboard interface</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>No matter the current state of the web application, the dashboard will always give four statistical results:</p>
            <ul role="list">
                <li><strong>Products</strong> - Indicates how many products we have registered in the database.</li>
                <li><strong>Claimed Licenses</strong> - Indicates how many Licenses have been claimed (validated) at least once.</li>
                <li><strong>Claimed Proportion</strong> - Measures the proportion of licenses that were claimed against non-claimed ones.</li>
                <li><strong>Licenses Awaiting Activation</strong> - In contrast to <strong>Claimed Licenses</strong>, it indicates the licenses whose customers haven't validated.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Administrators cannot do much to manipulate most of these statistics. The utility of the content in this page is to merely showcase the current status of the web application, its popularity and to display a quick study of the application's traction based on the available <strong>Customers</strong>, <strong>Licenses</strong> and <strong>Products</strong>. At the end of the page, the four most popular products (or less, if there are less than four existing products) are showcased from left to right based on popularity. The popularity criteria is measured based on the amount of <a>distinct</a> clients who have licenses associated to this Product.</p>
            <blockquote>
            <p>Statistical thinking will one day be as necessary for efficient citizenship as the ability to read and write.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Although not entirely necessary, this criteria can be changed by modifying the API Database method that handles the querying of these results. Nonetheless, in any case, the purpose of this tutorial isn't to elaborate on the implementation details.</p>

            <p>The <strong>Products</strong> tab allows administrators to create, edit or even view detailed information about existing products. When it comes to these functionalities, administrators don't have any restrictions compared to the Owner. The web application will, however, keep a log for every single action committed and it will be available in the <strong>Changelog</strong> page for every other administrator to see. This is done as a security measure but also to help keeping track of the application's history.</p>
            <p>On the picture on the right you can see a card-like box containing the details of a product example. Every single product will be represented in this format, with its image, its name and the category we defined. At the bottom of each card, we have two options: <strong>Edit</strong> or <strong>View</strong>. Clicking on <strong>Edit</strong> will bring up a modal where we will be able to edit the parameters of the Product whose card we clicked on. On the other hand, if we click on <strong>View</strong> we will be redirected to the individual page of the specified Product.</p>
            <p>On the top-right corner of the webpage, we have also have an <strong>Add Product</strong> button which will open a modal similar to the <strong>Edit</strong> feature and where we can fill out the parameters before creating a product.</p>

              <p>As indicated, whenever we click on the <strong>Edit</strong> or <strong>Create</strong> buttons, a modal similar to the one on the left image will be shown to us. If the feature is <strong>Edit</strong>, then the fields on the left will already be filled with the details of the currently existing product, otherwise, we will only have placeholders.</p>
              <p>You can notice that the API Key and Product Key are not visible in the modal. This is intentional as the server will be the one generating the API Key and Public Key for us when we ask it to create a product (editing won't modify the API Key or Public Key). You will only need to register the following parameters:</p>
              <ul role="list">
                <li><strong>Product Name</strong> - The name of the product (must be unique).</li>
                <li><strong>Product Category</strong> - The category is discretionary and merely informative.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Image</strong> - The image used to represent the product. 400x400 resolution is recommended, if not, the browser will scale it down, which can create a blur effect.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Details</strong> - It's another informative field, but helps pinpointing the information of the product.</li>
                </ul>
              <p>After pressing 'Create', the page will be reloaded.</p>
